**Project Overview**

(This project was done way back in 2021)
This data science project focuses on the analysis of the food industry, specifically centered around the behavior of people, their food preferences, and the prediction of food-related businesses. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Zomato, one of the most successful food delivery apps, based in Bengaluru, India. Bengaluru was chosen as the focal city for its diverse population with unique regional tastes, making it an ideal location to explore a wide range of preferences.
Python, along with its pre-defined libraries, is employed for data analysis, visualization, and sentiment analysis. The project encompasses a variety of aspects, including:

Food Preferences and Behavior Analysis: This involves understanding how people's preferences and behaviors relate to food, tastes, and dining choices.

Predictive Analysis for Food Businesses: The project explores predictive models to aid in the decision-making process for food businesses.

Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to analyze user reviews from various restaurants, focusing on aspects such as ambience and food quality.

**Background**
In recent years, the food industry has witnessed significant growth driven by factors like increased internet access, smartphone sales, rising income levels, and a growing working population. People's busy lifestyles have led to a surge in the popularity of online food services, with Zomato emerging as a prominent player in the field of food delivery and restaurant aggregation. Zomato has collected extensive datasets from various cities, enabling in-depth analysis. The project primarily centers on Bengaluru, a city renowned for its diverse culinary culture.

**Project Goals**
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Food and Beverage Industry Insights: Extract insights about the food and beverage industry, helping to shape future business strategies.

Restaurant Assessment: Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of various restaurants to address current issues and predict potential challenges.

Categorized Reviews: Develop a generalized categorization system for raw reviews to assist restaurants in improving and guide customers in making informed choices.

**Key Features of the Proposed System**
The proposed system offers several enhancements compared to the existing system:

Detailed Analysis: Unlike the existing system, which has limited attributes, the proposed system delves into a comprehensive analysis. It can answer diverse questions, such as identifying the most popular food dish in a specific area.

Data Visualization: The system employs over fifteen useful attributes, facilitating the creation of informative visual representations like word clouds and heat maps.

Sentiment Analysis with LSTM: A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed for sentiment analysis. LSTM is an excellent choice for classifying lengthy reviews, as it retains context and considers key phrases, ensuring more accurate results.

**Conclusion**
This data science project leverages the rich dataset from Zomato to gain insights into the diverse food preferences of people in Bengaluru. Through in-depth analysis, predictive modeling, and sentiment analysis, the project aims to empower both restaurants and customers with valuable information. The proposed system offers a more comprehensive and detailed approach to understanding the food industry, which can be invaluable in shaping future strategies and enhancing customer experiences.
